# Coding Project Profile Page

The purpose of this project was to show a company my current
development skills where I was allowed to use any mobile 
technologies I desired.

I decided on using Flutter as I have very little experience with it but I also know
that this company actively uses this tech and wants people who are interested in Flutter/Dart.

Total Completion time: 10 hours.

## Getting Started

- First make sure that you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine.
    - I am currently using Flutter 3.3.9 and Dart 2.18.5 for this project

      - https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
      - https://dart.dev/get-dart

- Clone the repo to your local machine
- Open the project in your IDE of choice (I am using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate)

## Installing dependencies
- Download the dependencies by running `flutter pub get` in the terminal

## Running the project
- Run the project by running `flutter run` in the terminal OR by clicking the green play button in the top right of the IDE


- If you are using an emulator, you will need to have an emulator running before running the project
    - I am using the iPhone 14 Pro Max emulator which can be opened on Mac if installed by using `open -a Simulator` in the terminal
    - You can find more information on how to set up an emulator here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-ios-emulator
    - You can create an Android emulator in Android Studio by going to Tools -> AVD Manager -> Create Virtual Device
    - You can also run the project on a physical device by connecting it to your machine and running `flutter run` in the terminal
